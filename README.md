# TopDownAdventure
A 2D top down adventure game in C++ using the raylib programming library
Current Controls are WASD to move and right click to attack.
This is a fun short top down adventure where you control a character and explore a small world created with tiled. The project was made in C++ using visual studio code and the raylib prgramming library. 
The project is used to demonstrate an understanding of C++  from the basics of C++ to more intricate uses of object oriented programming ranging from Classes, inheritance, function overrides (as well as the use ofvector math) etc. 
All assets were free to use as an extension of gamedev.Tv's learning tools, 
Music is copyright free music from feslyianstudio.
The project will be expanded upon over time with music, worlds and extra mechanics like projectiles etc. 
With this project I hope to also demonstrate my understanding of data structures and algorithms with more advanced pathfinding techniques and AI combat systems.
 With any issues running the project for source files for characters and props you may need to switch the directory folder in code ex. run animation "assets/knight_run" may change to "/myAssets_knight_run" depending on if you decide to make changes to the file folder upon downloading.
